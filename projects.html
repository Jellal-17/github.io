            <h2>Apple counting using machine learning</h2>
            <p>We have employed two machine learning techniques to accurately count apples in an orchard, streamlining agricultural processes. The first method used YoloV5s, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, and the second method was a conventional approach using a blob detection algorithm on top of a mask created using HSV colour space. The project aimed to compare the accuracy and efficiency of these two approaches. The results showed that YoloV5s performed better in accuracy and speed than the conventional image processing method.</p>

            <h2>A Case Study of Socially and Physically Assistive Robots in Human-Robot Interaction</h2>
            <p>We have Conducted an in-depth analysis of socially and physically assistive robots, examining their impact on human-robot interaction and potential applications in various settings. The two experiments discussed in the demonstrated the potential of socially and physically assistive robots in improving the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. In the first experiment, the socially assistive robot, Pepper, was able to assist a partially sighted social worker, Claudia, with various daily tasks. The results indicated that Pepper’s interaction with Claudia was positive and effective in assisting her with these tasks. The second experiment aimed to determine whether a TurtleBot3 robot could assist Claudia with her daily medication routine. The robot was programmed to deliver medication at specific times throughout the day directly to Claudia’s location, which was made possible by asking the robot to find the ’beacon location’ and navigate to that location on the map. The results showed that the robot could successfully deliver medication to Claudia at the stipulated time.</p>

            <h2>Path Traversing</h2>
            <p>Condsidering the following scenarion, we had to program our mobile robot to overcome the situation. "The robot will be dropped into the ocean; it must autonomously survey the length of a pipeline to find an expected breakage and then return to its drop-off point to be recovered." This has been successfully completed using the Pololu 3Pi+ mobile robot. Using its sensors, the robot was programmed to navigate a black tape line on the provided map autonomously</p>

    <!-- Investigating odometry errors-->
    <section> 
        <article>
            <h2>Investigating odometry errors caused during collisions due to bump sensors</h2>
            <p>We have our improved robot accelerometer and encoder-based kinematics using sensor fusion for IR based collision avoidance. Collisions are generally undesired in mobile robots. Most of the systems use a submodule of collision avoidance. In this report, we investigate the errors caused due to collision and how it varies according to different robot parameters, i.e. speed and angles. In the 3pi+ robot, we made an assumption based on existing literature on how it creates an Odometry inaccuracy. Our results use the mean and variance of the recorded error to explain the error magnitude in different scenarios.</p>
