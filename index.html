                <h3>Roboticist</h3>
            </hgroup>
            <p>Imagine a passionate and forward-thinking Robotics Master's student from the University of Bristol, where creativity meets expertise. With a solid background in mechanical engineering and a flair for machine learning, I craft cutting-edge solutions for autonomous systems. My journey is about embracing challenges, learning continuously, and making a real difference in the dynamic world of robotics. I am on the lookout for opportunities that not only fuel my growth but also allow me to leave a tangible mark on the future.</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>Apple counting using machine learning</h4>
                    <p>We have employed two machine learning techniques to accurately count apples in an orchard, streamlining agricultural processes.</p>

                <!-- Social Robots-->
                <article>
                    <h4>A Case Study of Socially and Physically Assistive Robots in Human-Robot Interaction</h4>
                    <p>We have Conducted an in-depth analysis of socially and physically assistive robots, examining their impact on human-robot interaction and potential applications in various settings.</p>

                <!-- Path Traversing-->
                <article>
                    <h4>Path Traversing</h4>
                    <p>Condsidering the following scenarion, we had to program our mobile robot to overcome the situation. "The robot will be dropped into the ocean; it must autonomously survey the length of a pipeline to find an expected breakage and then return to its drop-off point to be recovered." </p>
