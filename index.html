                <h3>Roboticist</h3>
            </hgroup>
            <p>Imagine a passionate and forward-thinking Robotics Master's student from the University of Bristol, where creativity meets expertise. With a solid background in mechanical engineering and a flair for machine learning, I craft cutting-edge solutions for autonomous systems. My journey is about embracing challenges, learning continuously, and making a real difference in the dynamic world of robotics. I am on the lookout for opportunities that not only fuel my growth but also allow me to leave a tangible mark on the future.</p>
