            <h2>Threshold response models applied to best-of-n in Swarm Robotics</h2>
            <p>We have employed two machine learning techniques to accurately count apples in an orchard, streamlining agricultural processes. The first method used YoloV5s, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, and the second method was a conventional approach using a blob detection algorithm on top of a mask created using HSV colour space. The project aimed to compare the accuracy and efficiency of these two approaches. The results showed that YoloV5s performed better in accuracy and speed than the conventional image processing method.</p>
